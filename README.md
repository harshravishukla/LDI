# LDI
# These codes are used to test the leakage detection index method on a buried pipeline. 
# These results are used in the journal paper "EVALUATION OF THE INFLUENCE OF SOIL BACKFILL ON VIBRATION-BASED PIPELINE LEAKAGE DETECTION". 
# CSD.m file is used to estimate the cross spectral densities of all the accelerometer pairs and LDI.m file is used to calculate the 
# leakage detction index. 
# Final LDI results are presented in "LDI Value 0-400Hz.xlsx". 
# Please refer to the published paper to get the link of dataset used in this paper to reproduce these results. The paper is published in 
# the Journal of Pipeline Systems - Engineering and Practice. 
# Link to the paper to be provided soon.
